8              Important updates:
9              04/08/2003 Remove ability to run application through the WWW
10             06/23/2003 Need to read Swedish death rates to compare against
11                        Add internal comparisons of old and new data
12             01/22/2004 Changed &country macro to be defined from environment
13                        variables and
14                        Added step to %getSWE macro that saves life tables
15                          for &country (for later use)
16                          before reading in SWE life tables
17             03/30/2004 &countryname stuck on Sweden when &country not in
18                         lookup table.  Change to take countryname from environ
19                         and restore it in %getSWE   CB, DG
20             21Sep04    modified %UPCASE, etc to handle new naming scheme
