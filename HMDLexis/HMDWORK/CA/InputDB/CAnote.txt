Estimates of 1960 population by state were taken from two data
sources, from the 1960 Census by sex, state, and age (single-year) and
by sex, state, and age (5-yr age groups).  The 5-yr-age-group
tabulations are more complete but do not provide the detail of the
1-yr-age group tabulations.  These estimates distribute the
5-yr-age-group tabulations over 1-yr-age groups using the relative
population distribution from the 1-yr tabulations.

NCHS only published total births by state for the year 1967.  For this
year, we applied the US national sex ratio at birth to each state
to estimate births by sex.
