Instructions for working inside the RLexisDB folder structure.

This is where functions are stored, with an eye on future packaging. That is to say, functions should be written in the form that they will finally take when packaged.

Specifically, this entails:
1) do not use source()- assume that functions are mutually aware
2) do not use load() or data()- assume that package data objects are accessible to the functions. This may only be the case with country.lookup (a table also included in RLifeTables/
3) do not use library() or require() for auxiliary packages; instead use package::function() (two colons, not three). try to minimize use of exterior packages. reshape2:: is heavily used in the lifetable programs.

the folders /data/, /doc/, /man/ are reserved for R to use when packaging. The /R/ folder should only contain files that end in .R and that will end up in the packaged product. Other .R files used for testing, etc, should be kept elsewhere. .R files in /R/ should also have the Roxygen header written once in a roughly stable form. It's better to do it early in development instead of later, as more than one person may work with a given file, and it helps explain things.

to activate the package as if loaded with library(), prior to packaging (during development), use the devtools package.

install.packages("devtools")

then use the load_all() function, like this:

load_all("path/to/RLexisDB")

and all pre-package functions will be in memory. This is a clean way to move forward in developing.
